Q4->
I think I longest time I spent for a question would be question 1 on which I practically spent one whole day. Although looking at question 1 now, it won't take me more than an hour to finish. Question 1 has the longest time spent, because it took me some time to go back and refamiliarize my with c language. I think using java or python in my previous semester, made it a bit harder for me to return to c. so while working on question 1, I learned a lot of c, regarding opening a directory or file, how to read a file, how to split a string in c, working with the printf statements. I think question 1 was the perfect question to begin the assignment on, because it smashes you into the c language and your desires to adapt to it while preparing you for the coming question.
Question 2 was fairly simple to solve and I think the only problem I faced with was reading from a file with different datatypes, I used fscanf() function to help me solve this problem by reading  both the data types (char and double) from the file at same time and discarding the unwanted string. I used strcmp() func to specifically get the memory values I wanted and calculate the memutil.    
After finishing Question 1 & 2, Question 3 was relatively easier to begin and it long me less than 45 mins to finish it. The main challenge for me with question 2 was handling '=' and '"' signs while reading from a file. I adapted to using fscanf() and strtok() as string modfier in getting me the desired solution.
In retrospect while the assignement is easy and simple, the outdated and sometimes lack of proper documentation for c language, made it a bit harder to learn and find examples of stuff I wanted my code to do.
