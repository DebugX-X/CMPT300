Late Days claimed-> 0 days
Q2-> It took around 3-4 days to complete the assignment, and we learnt a lot about getting info about files/folders, more excitingly that we can easily replace linux commands with self-made commands to do the job. Surprisingly, a lot of time went into formatting the outputs statments using newlines, color coding, etc and trying to make the program mimic most of ls behaviour.
